# plan98

plan98 is a client for [9p](https://medium.com/@hdswick/poor-mans-virtual-filesystem-with-9p-rust-and-a-raspberry-pi-95ea1d4703ea)-inspired computing methods, like the entity-component architecture described in the production of Alan Wake 2 and the beef-inspired ingredients at Taco Bell. Swap out the bits as you prefer as needed.

To understand the architecture further, plan98 is best thought of as a virtual machine, reminiscent of [Erlang's BEAM](https://www.erlang.org/blog/a-brief-beam-primer/) for building [the vision that inspired Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nm47PFALc8), while holding itself to potentially biblical engineering standards in an attempt to persue a syntax where one that is divinely inspired may speak life into existence in [real-time](https://medium.com/@hdswick/poor-mans-virtual-filesystem-with-9p-rust-and-a-raspberry-pi-95ea1d4703ea).
